        Instructions
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 220°C (428°F). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.</li>
        <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer it to a baking sheet or a pizza peel if using a pizza stone.</li>
        <li>Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, followed by the pepperoni slices or your choice of toppings.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a tablespoon of olive oil over the top and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the pizza onto the stone. If using a baking sheet, simply place it in the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool for a minute. Top with fresh basil leaves if desired.</li>
