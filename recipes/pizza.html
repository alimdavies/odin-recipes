        Instructions
    </h2>
    <p>
        1. Preheat your oven to 220°C (428°F). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.<br>
        2. Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer it to a baking sheet or a pizza peel if using a pizza stone.<br>
        3. Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.<br>
        4. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, followed by the pepperoni slices or your choice of toppings.<br>
        5. Drizzle a tablespoon of olive oil over the top and season with salt and pepper to taste.<br>
        6. If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the pizza onto the stone. If using a baking sheet, simply place it in the oven.<br>
        7. Bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling.<br>
        8. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a minute. Top with fresh basil leaves if desired.<br>
        9. Slice and serve hot.
