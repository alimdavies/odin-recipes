        Instructions
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water according to package instructions until al dente.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat a pan over medium heat and add the diced pancetta or guanciale. Cook until crispy, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Pecorino Romano cheese until well combined. Season with a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is cooked, reserve a cup of pasta water and then drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>Add the drained pasta to the pan with the crispy pancetta or guanciale and toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the heat. Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, stirring vigorously to create a creamy sauce. Add reserved pasta water a little at a time if needed to reach desired consistency.</li>
