    <ol>
        <li>Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water according to package instructions until al dente.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat a pan over medium heat and add the diced pancetta or guanciale. Cook until crispy, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Pecorino Romano cheese until well combined. Season with a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is cooked, reserve a cup of pasta water and then drain the pasta.</li>
