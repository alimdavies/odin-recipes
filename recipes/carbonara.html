        - 100g pancetta or guanciale, diced<br>
        - 2 large eggs<br>

        Instructions
    </h2>
    <p>
        1. Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water according to package instructions until al dente.<br>
        2. While the pasta is cooking, heat a pan over medium heat and add the diced pancetta or guanciale. Cook until crispy, about 5-7 minutes.<br>
        3. In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Pecorino Romano cheese until well combined. Season with a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.<br>
        4. Once the pasta is cooked, reserve a cup of pasta water and then drain the pasta.<br>
        5. Add the drained pasta to the pan with the crispy pancetta or guanciale and toss to combine.<br>
        6. Remove the pan from the heat. Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, stirring vigorously to create a creamy sauce. Add reserved pasta water a little at a time if needed to reach desired consistency.<br>
        7. Serve immediately, topped with extra Pecorino Romano and freshly ground black pepper.
