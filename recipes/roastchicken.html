    <p>
        1. Preheat your oven to 220째C (428째F).<br>
        2. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and place it in a roasting pan.<br>
        3. Rub the olive oil all over the chicken, then season generously with salt and pepper.<br>
        4. Squeeze the juice of one lemon half over the chicken and place the squeezed lemon halves inside the cavity along with the smashed garlic cloves and fresh herbs.<br>
        5. Arrange the quartered onion, carrots, and potatoes around the chicken in the oasting pan. Drizzle with a little more olive oil and season with salt and pepper.<br>
        6. Roast the chicken in the preheated oven for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 75째C (165째F) and the juices run clear when pierced at the thigh.<br>
        7. Baste the chicken with the pan juices halfway through cooking to keep it moist.<br>
        8. Once cooked, remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for about 10-15 minutes before carving.<br>
        9. Serve the roast chicken with the roasted vegetables on the side.
